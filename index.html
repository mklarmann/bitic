<p>We believe that by implementing credits and insurances through algorithms, decentralization and bitcoin will benefit people and organizations by enabling the best reliable and trustworthy financial services yet possible.</p>

<h4>
<a name="credit" class="anchor" href="#credit"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Credit</h4>

<p>The idea is to establish clear identities on persons and organizations via a web of trust and certificates. By trusting a person, you are giving them a credit line. The accumulated credit line for a person is the provided security for a credit he may take from a lender. Paying back your credit, will reward you with a bigger credit from this lender. In case of a projections on a possible credit line in the future an interest is taken for the risk, this risk is calculated transparently through probabilities by the algorithm.</p>

<h4>
<a name="insurance" class="anchor" href="#insurance"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Insurance</h4>

<p>There is a dedicated service that will act in case of emergencies. By opting-in the insurance services, the emergency case of a person is distributed to all other people who have opted-in the same service. You can only opt-in if you have sufficient funds or credit line.</p>

<p>Documents of conventional insurance services may be linked into the system. Using buttercoin also fiat currencies add to the securities. These official documents are linked by peers into the trust structure.</p>

<p>There is a immediate dynamic in case of an insurance pay-out. There has to be a trusted peer checking the documents, that the pay-out was used for the claimed purpose.</p>
